Reliable media extraction, stream resolution and playback support for Levyra.

## About

LevyraExtractor is the media extraction layer used by **Levyra**.

It reads metadata, discovers playable audio and video streams, selects suitable formats and gives the app clearer information when a source cannot be resolved.

The project is based on the NewPipe and PipePipe ecosystem, with additional work focused on Levyra's playback needs.

This is an independent downstream project. It is not an official NewPipe, PipePipe, Metrolist, Google or YouTube repository.

## Main features

- YouTube audio and video stream resolution
- Android VR client support
- SABR stream discovery
- Automatic format selection
- Fast short-lived caching
- Duplicate request sharing
- Playback and fallback diagnostics
- SponsorBlock integration
- Return YouTube Dislike integration
- Support for YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, PeerTube, media.ccc.de, BiliBili and NicoNico

## Why it exists

Levyra needs an extractor that is fast, predictable and easy to diagnose when upstream services change.

LevyraExtractor keeps the proven foundation of its upstream projects while adding a dedicated resolution layer for the Levyra player.

The main goal is simple: make playback more reliable without hiding failures or making the host application harder to maintain.

## Requirements

LevyraExtractor targets **Java 17** and is distributed through **JitPack**.

The host application must provide its own downloader and remains responsible for network timeouts, retries, cancellation and response cleanup.

Release information and published versions are available from the repository releases and JitPack pages.

## Credits

LevyraExtractor would not exist without the work of the open-source community.

Core upstream projects:

- [NewPipeExtractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor) — original extractor architecture and service implementations
- [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) — original application and ecosystem
- [PipePipe](https://codeberg.org/NullPointerException/PipePipe) — extended downstream ecosystem
- [PipePipeExtractor](https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipeExtractor) — main downstream extractor lineage
- [MetrolistExtractor](https://github.com/MetrolistGroup/MetrolistExtractor) — reference work for modern YouTube playback handling
- [Metrolist](https://github.com/MetrolistGroup/Metrolist) — open-source YouTube Music client ecosystem
- [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) — community skip-segment data
- [Return YouTube Dislike](https://github.com/Anarios/return-youtube-dislike) — community rating data
